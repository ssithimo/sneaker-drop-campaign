# Foot Locker Sneaker Drop 📬 A/B Subject Line Test

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project tests the effectiveness of two subject lines for a Foot Locker sneaker drop email campaign. The goal is to identify which subject line drives more opens, thereby increasing customer engagement and downstream sales potential.

## 📧 Test Variants
- **Email A (Control):** “Hurry! Limited pairs remaining.”
- **Email B (Variant):** “Drop alert 🔥 Your exclusive access inside.”

The **email content is identical** across both groups, isolating the effect of the subject line alone.

## 📊 Methodology
- Simulated dataset of 20,000 users (10,000 per group)
- Conducted a **two-proportion z-test** to assess statistical significance in open rates between groups

## ✅ Key Findings
- **Email B produced a significantly higher open rate** (27.6% vs. 24.1%)

## 📝 Conclusion
- Email B is the preferred subject line for future campaigns due to its ability to capture more initial attention.  

- Recommended next step: Run new A/B tests on **email content**, now that the optimal subject line is established.
