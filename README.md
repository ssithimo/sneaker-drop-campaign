# 👟 Exclusive Sneaker Drop Email Subject Line A/B Test

## 🎯 Project Objective  
This project tests two email subject lines to determine which drives better customer engagement for an exclusive sneaker drop campaign at Foot Locker. The email content remains **identical**; only the subject line varies.

---

## 📋 Test Setup  
- **Variation A:** “Hurry! Limited pairs remaining.” 
- **Variation B:** “Drop alert 🔥 Your exclusive access inside.” 
- **Sample Size:** 10,000 users per group  
- **Email Content:** Same for both variations (layout, links, images)

---

## 📈 Key Metrics  
- **Open Rate:** Measures subject line effectiveness  

---

## ✅ Results  
- **Open Rate:** Variation B showed a **statistically significant higher open rate**, indicating better performance at grabbing attention.  

---

## 🧠 Conclusion  
- The subject line impacts open rates significantly.  
- Since email content was identical, the difference is confidently attributed to the subject line.  
- **Recommendation:** Use Variation B for the full campaign to maximize opens.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Test email content variations (e.g., call-to-action, layout).  
- Personalize subject lines for different user segments.  
- Track downstream conversion rates to link opens and clicks to revenue.
